  <h3>Biography</h3>
  <p>I go to school at Sunset Jr. High, and before that I went to Clinton Elementary. I am not focused in any partiuclar subject, though I gravitate towards science classes as apposed to say English or Math. In high school, I am looking forward to
    taking health and chemistry classes. I play some instruments for school, and I will be doing jazz guitar and symphony orchestra next year.</p>
  <p>I live in Clinton, Utah, and have my whole life. My family has four boys, two girls, and a dog. The only hobby I have is playing music, and the instruments I can play are the cello, guitar, bass guitar, and the piano. I enjoy hanging out with my friends
    (big surprise) and cooking.</p>
